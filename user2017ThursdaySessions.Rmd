##moodler: A new R package to easily fetch data from Moodle (in no time)

####Moodle
- Big open-source learning platform
- 100 million users
- community driven with 1300 plugins
- consist of database + file storage
- Database stores logs on webpage useage, discussion forum and quizes
- Analytics plugins inside moodle are pretty static and not adopted to R!
- In order to get data into R you need SQL + Moodle DB knowledge
- library(moodler)
- library(igraph)

##Can you keep a secret?

- Secrets: Database connection, cloud service authentication, API keys
- Secrets in plain text in script!!!
- Potentially leak  by e-mail, from R (history, .Rdata) and private to public Githib repository
- Solution: Encrypted file inside your project --> Public key cryptography
- Public and private key pairs
- Decrypt using your own private key
- library(secret) - Open SSL infrastructure
- Create vault, add users, encrypt and decrypt secrets
####Use cases: 
- Encrypt a secret to use on different machines
- Encrypt a secret to share with team
- Encrypt secret to use with continuous integration


##Scraping data with rvest and purrr

- Based on tidyverse, especially purrr and rvest
- Presentor working with loans to consumers nut personla interest in football

##ReinforcementLearning - A package for replicating human behavior in R

- Two parts, first: reinforment learning, second: the package
- Reinforcement learning: human-like-learning, trial-and-error interactions, dynamic environment
- Examples: robotics, stock market, AI (Atari games)
- Feedback of agent restricted to reward signal - imporove behavior
- Agent - Environment interface
- Goal: Best action in each state
- Experience Replay - Require samples consisting of states, actions and rewards
- Batch reinforcemtn learning - Collect sample sequences
- Package: ReinforcementLearning -> close the gap in R
- Data format required: (s,a,r,s_new) - current environment, action, reward, next environment - data.frame
- Case study: Gridword - celll = state (4 states)
- Learning parameters

##Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing in R

- Text categorization with CNN in Mxnet
- Why CNN? Learn complex hierachical features
- Convolutions - kernel of weights
- Crepe model: text categorisation
- Alphabet  = 69 = rows, columns = 1014 characters (symboler) - creating the matrix with letters
- Convolutional stage - MXnet
- Non-Linrat activation function- ReLU
- Pooling to reduce the dimensions
- Stacked convolutional layers
- Flattening
- Randomly dropping in order to not overfit
- Gradient Decent for training
- Training time 24h with 2 GPUs with a 2 million sample
- aka.ms/deep-learning-for-nlp
- 256 filters in each layer

##R4ML: An R based Scalable Machine Learning Framework

- A R-language front end to Apache SystemML
- SparkR is a Thin Wrapper Over Apache Spark
- Linear Algebra at Scale
- Apache SystemML
- library(R4ML)
- library(SparkR)
- Grid search to improve accuracy


##Computer Vision and image recognition algorithms for R users

- library(magick), library(imageR) etc. packages already exist
- Github: bnosac/image (6 packages in image)
- presentor going through six oackages
- image.CorenerDetectionF9 - detect corners in image
- image.CannyEdges - find edges in images
- image.LineSegmentDetector - detect lines in image
- image.ContourDetector - detect contour lines
- magick - convert jpeg to ppgm
- image.dlib - detect robust features (SURF) - detect faces?
- image.darknet - detect location in images based on dark weight 


##Depth and depth-based classification with R package ddalpha

- Data depth implementation
- How deep is a point in the data, 0 far away, 1 if close to center
- linear separation to include the point but creating smallest sample
- Classification: calculate depth with respect to both classes
- Depth-based classification - library(ddalpha)

##Keynote: Parallel Computation in R

- General Design Patterns for parallel computations
- library(partools)
- Parallel hardware for the masses; 4 cores standrd, GPUs
- Intel Xeon Phi ~ 60 cores
- Big Data - wahtever that is
- Non-"embarrassingly parallel" algorithmns
- Bandwidth limitations - cPU/memory etc.
- Broad user base makes it a challenge
- Example: Matrix-Vector Multiplicaton with for loop - short calcuations = time consuming
- Use cases: Quantile regression, Nearest-Neighbor regression, graph algos, group-by-and-find-means
credit card fraud detection
- Software Alchemy (SA) data to chunks and apply lm() to each chunk and average (parallelize)
- Message passing/distributed comp. parallel package
- Shared-memory - process access to common memory
- Conclusion: Hype in parallel computation.
- Automatic parallelizatoin overrated.
- What do APIs do?
- Machine Learning = Linear Regression!!
- Use: SA & Distributed computation
- SparkR is hyped! - No transparency and not suited for most of hte above use cases.
- MPI/OpenMP outperforms Spark (Reyes-Ortiz)
- library(parallel) --> manger scatters, make workers calculate, and only calculate the final results!
- Chunk files already from the beginning
- "Leave it there" - avoiding overloading the network
- colMeans() at the end
